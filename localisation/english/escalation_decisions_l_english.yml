  escalation_category_desc: "Our participation in some crises may still play into our hands if we fan the flames or help resolve the conflict.\nWhile the conflict is in force, each participant receives penalties to political power and legitimacy. The conflict can end in case of its freezing, a war between the main participants or after the timer expires for all participants. Completing more than one decision weekly increases escalation points of opponents.\n\nEscalation points: §Y[?escalation_score]§!\nEscalation level:"
